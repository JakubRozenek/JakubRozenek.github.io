      <h3>Jakub Rozenek</h3>
	  <p>
	  I've been programming in python for about 6 years. However, I learnt programming at home by myself because
	  of the problem the school had with me picking GCSE Computer Science. However, when going into A-Level the teachers
	  saw my passion and they knew about my problem with GCSE Computer Science; so they allowed me to do A-Level Computer
	  Science with no prior experience (Only in programming). At the end of the 2 years i was averaging a A/B in my exams.
	  Therefore I was very fortunate and grateful that the school gave me an opportunity to do A-Level Computer Science.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Solar System Viewer</h3>
	<p>
	My first programming project, which was completed during the 2 week Programming bootcamp
	at City University Of London (2020). This project was written in processing which is a simplier
	version of java. This processing project demonstrates my understanding of the use
	of classes and 3D graphics in processing. I created a solar system viewer in which your able to pick the desired
	planet from 1 - 9 (Same order as the solar system) which are stored in a class in another file. The class
	is being called in order to draw the 3D sphere and apply the texture onto it. Finally, your able
	to see a few facts about the planet.
